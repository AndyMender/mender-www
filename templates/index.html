    <h1 class="title is-3">Greetings!</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Welcome to my humble blog!</strong></p>
        <p>Here, I document my toils and struggles. My musings and rumblings.
            My journey through the amazing world of electronics, technology and computing.</p>
        <p>Sit, stand up, lie down or take any other comfortable position of your choosing.
            More importantly, <em>enjoy</em>!</p>
        <p>I write mostly about computers, operating systems and programming languages.
            However, on occasion I take a deep dive into the world of politics, social sciences
            and economy if it tickles my fancy at any given time.</p>
        <p>You might like my ideas and writing style or you might not. Regardless, I encourage you,
            the reader to at least have a look at my many posts. Who knows, maybe you will find
            something to your liking after all...</p>
