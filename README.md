A small Web development project for my personal website/blog

This project was built using:
- front-end: HTML/CSS with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and Python with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
- back-end: Python with [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html)
- Web serving: [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

The project attempts to follow the venerable [MVC design paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), though I took some liberties in defining the directory hierarchy and overall project structure.
